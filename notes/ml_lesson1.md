# Fast AI : Machine Learning

## Lesson 1
- Use curl to inspect element and download data
- Download bulldozers notebook
- Open jupyter notebook

#### Data Analysis
- `imports.py` contains all the imports
- `pd.read_csv`,`low_memory` should be true as it reads more data
- `f'Hello {PATH}'` python3.6 feature
- See the size of the file
- `df_raw.tail().transpose()` to see all columns easily
- Dont look at the data. Do machine learning driven EDA
- Look at the evaluation section for RMSE/RMSLE error
- `RMSLE` means that they are about ratios more than differences.

### Random Forest
- `Universal Machine Learning Techniques`. It does not generally overfit.
- It generalizes well. It has few statistical assumptions.
- `Curse of dimensionality` data lies in a very sparse space and loses its relavence.
- `No Free Lunch` there aint any model that is good at every dataset.
- All ML algorithms need numbers as inputs.
- `Data` has some interesting properties
- `Year`, `Month`, `Week`, `Quarter`, `is_holiday`, `is_weekend`.
